# Project idea
Sustainify is a cookie-clicker game that aims to educate players on climate change through topics such as: sustainable development practices, clean energy sources, and causes and effects of climate change.

# Project background/Business Opportunity
Sustainify is a video game that aims to educate players on climate change through topics such as: sustainable development practices, clean energy sources, and causes and effects of climate change. By facilitating the learning experience through a video game, the goal is to provide a more entertaining, and alternative way for the younger audience to learn about and engage in these topics. Sustainify will be a ‘Cookie Clicker’ genre game, where the player clicks to gain points, and invests into passive point generators. With this style of game, the game will be easy to pick up and play, require low hardware requirements to play the game, and easy to provide educational tidbits that aren’t overly impeding to the gameplay. 

With the constantly increasing urgency of climate change, it becomes more and more crucial to mitigate the effects of it. One of the first steps to making a change is education on the topic in question. There are few video games currently that focus on providing an educational experience around sustainable development and climate change, especially in the genre of idle/cookie-clicker games. Sustainify aims to provide a tool in that gap, that provides an easy to play game, with a core educational component surrounding sustainable development, and climate change.
